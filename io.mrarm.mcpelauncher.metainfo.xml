    <description>
        <p>
            To use this launcher you have to own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on google play store, you may be unable to play the latest update of the Game. Otherwise you will get an license error while launching the google play apk.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an unofficial Linux launcher for the Minecraft Bedrock codebase. This project is not affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang or Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>Not available Features you may miss</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Xbox live friend joining - usually times out or crashs the game in both directions - consider using the offical server software <code>www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock</code> - connect all by ip as external server</li>
            <li>Xbox live login - a lot of devices seem to get error code "drowned" without beeing asked for login - error code "drowned" has more meanings like you closed the webview window without sign in - try to change your timezone to a different one and back</li>
        </ul>
